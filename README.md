# branchCustomerServiceApplication
This project is created on Spring Tool Suite 

# Download Spring Tool Suite
There is only need of downloading the STS.<br/><br/>
https://spring.io/tools
<br/>you can choose the tool according to the Operating System. <br/><br/>
And after successful downloading and set up of STS.

# Import my project
you can then download the zip file of my project from the repository, I shared with @branch-dev.<br/><br/>
or you can use this link https://github.com/deepaksharmacs19/branchCustomerServiceApplication  <br/><br/>
And after downloading the zip file extract it.<br/>
Then you can import my project directly on STS. <br/>
In STS, by double click on the package explorer, you will get several options and one of them is to import.<br/>
So import that folder that you extracted from that zip file.<br/>

# After importing the project : 

go to the BranchCustomerServiceApplication.java and double click on it there will be several options infront of you, just click on run as spring boot application.
<br/>By doing so the server will be started at port 8080<br/>
So go to the browser and just type localhost:8080 and there you go.<br/>
and as it is multiuser so you can open multiple tabs also with localhost:8080 and can answer customers queries.<br/><br/>
Thank you.....
