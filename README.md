# branchCustomerServiceApplication
This project is created on Spring Tool Suite 
So there is only need of downloading the STS.
And after successful downloading of STS download the zip file of my project.
Then you can import my project directly on STS. 
After importing the project : 

go to the BranchCustomerServiceApplication.java and run as spring boot application
then the server will be started at port 8080. 
So go to the browser and just type localhost:8080 and there you go.
and as it is multiuser so you can open multiple tabs also with localhost:8080 and can answer customers queries.
Thank you.....
