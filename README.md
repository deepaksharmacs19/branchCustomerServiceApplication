This project is created on Spring Tool Suite 

# Download Spring Tool Suite
There is only need of downloading the STS.
https://spring.io/tools
you can choose the tool according to the Operating System.
And after successful downloading and set up of STS.

# Import my project
you can then download the zip file of my project from the repository, I shared with @branch-dev.
or you can use this link https://github.com/deepaksharmacs19/branchCustomerServiceApplication
And after downloading the zip file extract it.
Then you can import my project directly on STS. 
In STS, by double click on the package explorer, you will get several options and one of them is to import.
So import that folder that you extracted from that zip file.

# After importing the project : 

go to the BranchCustomerServiceApplication.java and double click on it there will be several options infront of you, just click on run as spring boot application.
By doing so the server will be started at port 8080. 
So go to the browser and just type localhost:8080 and there you go.
and as it is multiuser so you can open multiple tabs also with localhost:8080 and can answer customers queries.
Thank you.....
